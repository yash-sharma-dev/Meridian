 * Single source of truth for premium access.
 * Covers all access paths: desktop API key, tester keys (wm-pro-key / wm-widget-key),
 * Clerk Pro role, and Convex Dodo entitlement (the latter two via isProUser).
 *
 * The Convex entitlement check is the authoritative signal for paying
 * customers — Clerk `publicMetadata.plan` is NOT written by our webhook
 * pipeline, so a user with a valid Dodo subscription would otherwise show
 * as free here even though isPanelEntitled() already allowed them past
 * the panel-rendering gate. That split caused paying users to see the
 * "Upgrade to Pro" paywall overlay on top of panels they were entitled to,
 * reproducing the 2026-04-17/18 duplicate-subscription incident.
 *
 * isEntitled() is folded into isProUser() (see widget-store.ts) so every
 * call site that checks isProUser — widgets, search, event handlers —
 * agrees with panel gating. That keeps this function a thin union of
 * signals that aren't already covered by isProUser.
